# RSS Editor Plugin for MCPi

**RSS Plugin** has been adopted and designed to attach to Clue MCPi
media player compatible RSS editor for RSS rending controls. This editor
will act as embedded editor in MCPi system configuration and will provide
functions to edit already attached RSS channels or to add more.
 
This plugin was design to run over ___Clue OS___ but it might work also 
on any Kodi version, over any _Debian_ operating system installed on RPi 
appliances.
